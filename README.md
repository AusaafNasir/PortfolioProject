# PortfolioProject

I took data from Max Roser, Hannah Ritchie, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina and Joe Hasell (2020) - "Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19)". Published online at OurWorldInData.org. Retrieved from: 'https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus' [Online Resource] and performed some data exploration on it. I wrote the actual script in SQL and created the visualizations in Tableau.

I will be making more changes in this project including doing some data cleaning using SQL
