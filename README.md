# PortfolioProject

"Data is beautiful."

Here I add my personal projects.

First Project - COVID dataExploration.sql

I took data from Max Roser, Hannah Ritchie, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina and Joe Hasell (2020) - "Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19)". Published online at OurWorldInData.org. Retrieved from: 'https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus' [Online Resource] and performed some data exploration on it. I wrote the actual script in SQL and created the visualizations in Tableau.

Second Project - Data Cleaning Portfolio Project Queries.sql

I took Nashville Housing Data and performed Data Cleaning on it using SQL. I used CONVERT to convert date from datetime format, found the null values and populated them after performing self join. I broke out columns with delimiters into individual columns using Substring, CharIndex and ParseName. Used CASE statement for converting values that met certain conditions. Removed duplicates using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and finally deleted the unused columns.
